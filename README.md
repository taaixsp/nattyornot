# **FakeOrNatty - Stock Predictions Project** 🚀📈

## 📒 **Description**
This project explores the challenge of distinguishing between real and AI-generated stock price movements. Using machine learning, I classify time series data to determine whether it follows authentic market patterns or is purely synthetic.

## 🤖 **Technologies Used**
**Generative AI & Synthetic Data:** Random Walk, ARIMA, Monte Carlo Simulation

**Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Random Forest

**Data & Processing:** Pandas, NumPy, Yahoo Finance API

**Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

## 🧐 **Creation Process**
**Real Data Collection 📊:** Extracted historical stock prices using the Yahoo Finance API.

**Synthetic Data Generation 🤖:** Simulated artificial stock trends with random walk models.

**Feature Engineering 🛠️:** Built statistical indicators like moving averages, volatility, and momentum.

**Model Training & Evaluation 🎯:** Trained a classifier to differentiate real vs. synthetic trends.

## 🚀 **Results**
**Accuracy:** The model achieved high precision in detecting fake vs. real stock data.

**Key Insights:** Real stock movements tend to have specific volatility patterns, while synthetic data often lacks autocorrelation.

**Visualization:** Plotted real vs. synthetic trends to highlight differences.

## 💭 **Thoughts on the Project**
Building a "natty" financial dataset was challenging because markets are highly unpredictable—sometimes, real stock movements look just as random as synthetic ones! AI can mimic trends well, but capturing human-driven market psychology remains complex.
